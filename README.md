My own solution to Advent Of Code

# Running

I have provided a batch file that will let you easily run any language.

```batch
REM FORMAT:
REM ./run.bat {YEAR} {DAY} {LANGUAGE}

./run.bat 2021 3 Javascript
```

# Support

| Language    | Coverage | Batch Name |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Javascript  | AD, AP   | Javascript |
| Lua         | AD, AP   | lua        |

* AP = Part 1 and 2, P1 = Part 1 Only, P2 = Part 2 Only
* AD = All Day, Dx-y = Day x to y, Dx = Day x
* Batch Name = This is the name you have to put in the LANGUAGE part of the arguement

# Credits

All of the function i got from Stackoverflow (Only in lua) have been credited above it's function name.
